# Simple Chatbot

This is a basic chatbot implemented in Python. It responds to predefined user inputs using regular expressions for pattern matching.

## How It Works

- The chatbot has a predefined set of responses stored in a dictionary.
- When a user enters a message, the chatbot checks if it matches any known keyword using regular expressions.
- If a match is found, the chatbot returns the corresponding response.
- If no match is found, it returns a default response.
- The chatbot runs in a loop until the user types "bye" to exit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Save the script as `chatbot.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using:


5. Start chatting with the bot.
